# Ducky to AHK
 A simple python script to convert Rubber Ducky payloads into AutoHotKey scripts.

 I have also added a sample payload for testing.
 
 I will add more keys and functions, but for now there are enough added that it is functional.
 
 Please keep in mind that unlike a Rubber Ducky, AHK **cannot** bypass UAC, as script execution is paused untill you exit it.

 Some commands *may* not work, such as ALT TAB, because the script replaces both with the appropriate send commands resulting in them being sent separately. In that case, fixing some of the output *may* be required...
